MAGNETOMETER DATA VISUALiSATION IN TIME-DOMAIN AND IN FFT-DOMAIN
===============================================================

> Get a chunk of magnetometer samples at 20Hz capture rate and display the coordinates of the acquired vector on screen, as a real-time graph.

> Then display FFT of the Z-axis data in the 0-5Hz interval

==> IF the user rotates the module around the X or Y axis regularly all along the capture time (so that the Z coordinates gets modulated), the FFT will illustrate the frequency at which this "swinging" has occured.
