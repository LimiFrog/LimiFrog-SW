BASIC DATA FLASH UNITARY TEST
=============================

- Check Manufacturer ID of Adesto Data Flash

- Write some random data into Flash, read back, wrte back complement, read back and check integrity of results

- Similar test for an unaligned start write address and a buffer smaller than one Flash page

- Get LED to blink if success, stay fixed if failure

BASIC OLED UNITARY TEST
========================

- Configure Board
- Initialize OLED

- After blue splash screen, switch 1 selects a uniform screen (cyan) while switch 2 selects a mosaic of rectangles;
  Position of each color in the mosaic rolls as long as switch 2 is maintained in pressed position

Clock Frequencies & USB Device Test (Mass Storage)
=================================================

Initialize board

Configure board as Mass Storage Device (8MB)
USB Device Stack runs on STM32, Physical Storage space is Data Flash

LimiFrog gets recognized by PC as USB Mass Storage drive.

LimiFrog turns LED on if USB line D+ is pulled high (meaning the STM32
is signalling itself as a USB device to the Host)
+ pressing push-button Switch1 toggles the LED as long as it remains pressed.


**Limitation**: if Flash is not empty and not FAT formatted, PC OS reports abnormal disk behavior.

If Flash is empty/erased, then PC proposes to format the drive (FAT16)
Note Flash can also be formatted by running demo "LimiFrog-FatFS-Format".

BASIC FatFS EXAMPLE -- using DataFlash as logical Disk
========================================================


** NOTE **:
LimiFrog must have been formatted as FAT file system first !
for example by plugging into Windows PC while USB firmware is running (if Flash is empty PC will offer to format disk)
or by running demo project "LimiFrog_FatFS-Format"
**********

Initialize Board
Launch USB so files can be checked from PC 

Open (create) a file FATFS.txt
Write a string in it
Close File

Open same file
Read String
Close file

Check that written and read back string have same length
Get LED to blink if success, else stay fixed

Test I2C access to all sensors
==============================

Initialize Board

Check I2C access to all sensors is OK 
and reported WHO_AM_I register value is correct.

Display result using "OLED_Printxxx" functions

==========================================================

Initialize Board
Check Access to VL60180X OK

Continuously monitor distance to any object placed in front of VL6180X
Display result as a colored bar of height proportional to measured distance

BlueTooth Low Energy Test
==========================

Initialize Module, Enable USB
With BTLE enabled in user configuration file,
 LBF_Board_Selective_Inits() will include download by STM32 of specified executable into BTLE module.

Upon pressing switch 1 (side-push button), La BLueFrog sends a text message over BTLE.
This can be read on ad-hoc iOS or Android application.


// ---- Pre-requisites :
// BTLE must be enabled by #define in User_Configuration.h
// Name of the file containing code to download by STM32 
// into BTLE module also defined there -- download occurs
// during LBF_Board_Selective_Inits() phase.
// This executable must be present on FAT File System on Flash 
// (typically stored there from PC through USB).
// In this demo, code is supposed to be Serial Port Service
// snippet provided by Dialog -- this configures the BTLE
// to behave as UART cable replacement. Data sent to
// BTLE module over UART1 at 115200 baud is transitted over BTLE
// This data can be received by DSPS application running in iOS
// or Android, provided by Dialog, available on Appple/Android
// app stores

TIMERS AND PWM
===============

Part 1: Free running timer 

Based on timer3 counter monitoring,
Flash LED every 0.5s, 8 times, using timer with 1ms resolution.
Short pause.
Do it again using timer with 1us resolution (same result !)


Part 2: Timer with IT generation.

Set up timer4 to elapse and generate IT after 30ms.
In Interrupt Servic Routine, toggle LED.
Let it run for 2 sec.
During these 2 sec: LED is blinking, toggling every 30ms
