VL6180X (Ambient Light + Proximity / Distance Sensor) Demo
==========================================================

Initialize Board
Check Access to VL60180X OK

Continuously monitor distance to any object placed in front of VL6180X
Display result as a colored bar of height proportional to measured distance

(might need some calibration for best accuracy?)


NOTE: For best results, up-to-date firmware settings and maximum flexibility, ST provides a full driver for the VL6180X. Although not used yet, this driver is part of this software package, see LimiFrog-SW/libraries/Sensors_APIs/Material_for_Future_Work
