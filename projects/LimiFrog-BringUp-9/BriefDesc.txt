TIMERS AND PWM
===============

Part 1: Free running timer 

Based on timer3 counter monitoring,
Flash LED every 0.5s, 8 times, using timer with 1ms resolution.
Short pause.
Do it again using timer with 1us resolution (same result !)


Part 2: Timer with IT generation.

Set up timer4 to elapse and generate IT after 0.5s.
In Interrupt Servic Routine, toggle LED.
Let it run for 5 sec.
During these 5 sec: LED is blinking, toggling every 500ms (period = 1Hz)

Then keep LED steadily on
