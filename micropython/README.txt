USING MICROPYTHON ON LIMIFROG :
===============================

- A port of MicroPython for LimiFrog is available on the official MicroPython repository on GitHub. Once fitted with this firmware, LimiFrog can execute all core MicroPython commands.

- At present there is no "official" support for sensors, BLE or display on this repo. However, Tobias B. who did the port has been working on this too; he has some useful code on his own repo.

 ===> Please refer to the documentation present in this folder under the name:  
         Micropythonize_Limifrog.pdf
      or follow this link:

GENERIC MICROPTYHON DOCUMENTATION :
===================================

MicroPython is "a lean and fast implementation of the Python 3 programming language that is optimized to run on a microcontroller".
Please visit: www.micropython.org for general documentation on MicroPython.
The examples provided there assume usage of the pyboard (the first board created to run MicroPython by Damien George, the father of MicroPython), but things will work very similarly on LimiFrog.


ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS:
===============
The port of MicroPython to the STM32L4 and to LimiFrog has been done by Tobias Badertscher (thanks!)
